First make sure you are in the "riddle_routes" directory. 
Then fun the following commands:

    cd riddle_routes
    npm start
This will start the program and create a local server you can join.

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to your server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
